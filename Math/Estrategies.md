#### Little tricks and strategies I have found for Math problems

## Always think about Lineal Algebra! (when given problems on a cartesian plane)
1. When you're asked to do some kind of rotation or some sort or vector/matrix operation always think about lineal algebra

2. Think about how to rotate a Vector in a 2D-plane

A example of this is LeetCode 1041
